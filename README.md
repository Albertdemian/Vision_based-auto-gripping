# Vision_based-auto-gripping
object detection based on classical machine vision approach using intel Realsense D435. Integrated with automatic gripping of objects. 

## Language: python 3

## special hardware: Intel Realsense D435 

In folder "scripts/.." containing live streaming scripts written in python using intelRealsense D435 
  some color filters are integrated within the code. 
  
In folder "object_detection/..":
  some scripts for classical object detection methods (SIFT) 
  
  *** the scripts still have some problems due to such algorithms are patented to their developers 
        solution is easy but I'm working on it***
