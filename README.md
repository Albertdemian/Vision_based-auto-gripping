# Vision-based auto gripping
object detection based on classical computer vision approaches with intel Realsense D435 for purpose of automated 
## Language: python 3
## Dependencies: 
> pyrealsense
> Opencv
> Imutils

## Hardware: Intel Realsense D435 

In folder "scripts/.." containing live streaming scripts. 
  
In folder "object_detection/..":
  some scripts for classical object detection methods (SIFT) 
  
  *** the scripts still have some problems due to such algorithms are patented to their developers 
        solution is easy but I'm working on it***
>> pip3 install opencv-python==3.4.2.16
